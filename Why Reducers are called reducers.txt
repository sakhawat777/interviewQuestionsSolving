Why Reducers are called reducers?

  Ans: Reducers come from array.reduce((PreviousResult, CurrentValue) => {return PreviousResult + CurrentValue}, 0).
  Reducers reduce actions and return a single value (Updated State).


 Reducers are called reducers because they reduce a collection of values into a single value. In computer programming, reducers are often used to aggregate or accumulate data by applying a function to each element of a collection and combining the results.

The term "reducer" comes from functional programming, where it is a common pattern for processing collections of data. In functional programming, reducers are often used in conjunction with higher-order functions like map, filter, and fold, which enable more complex transformations to be performed on collections.

The term "reducer" is also used in the context of parallel and distributed computing, where it refers to a function that combines the results of multiple computations into a single value. In this context, reducers are used to aggregate data across multiple processors or nodes in a cluster, enabling large-scale processing of data.

Overall, the term "reducer" is used to describe functions or processes that reduce the complexity of a collection of data by aggregating or summarizing it into a smaller set of values.
