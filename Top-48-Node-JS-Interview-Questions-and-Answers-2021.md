Beginner Node.js Interview Questions
This section will provide you with the Basic Node.js interview questions which will primarily help freshers.

1. What is Node.js? Where can you use it?
   Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment and library to run web applications outside the client’s browser. It is used to create server-side web applications.
   Node.js is perfect for data-intensive applications as it uses an asynchronous, event-driven model. You can use I/O intensive web applications like video streaming sites. You can also use it for developing: Real-time web applications, Network applications, General-purpose applications, and Distributed systems.
2. Why use Node.js?
   Node.js makes building scalable network programs easy. Some of its advantages include:
   • It is generally fast
   • It rarely blocks
   • It offers a unified programming language and data type
   • Everything is asynchronous
   • It yields great concurrency
3. How does Node.js work?
   A web server using Node.js typically has a workflow that is quite similar to the diagram illustrated below. Let’s explore this flow of operations in detail.

• Clients send requests to the webserver to interact with the web application. Requests can be non-blocking or blocking:
• Querying for data
• Deleting data
• Updating the data
• Node.js retrieves the incoming requests and adds those to the Event Queue
• The requests are then passed one-by-one through the Event Loop. It checks if the requests are simple enough not to require any external resources
• The Event Loop processes simple requests (non-blocking operations), such as I/O Polling, and returns the responses to the corresponding clients
A single thread from the Thread Pool is assigned to a single complex request. This thread is responsible for completing a particular blocking request by accessing external resources, such as computation, database, file system, etc.
Once the task is carried out completely, the response is sent to the Event Loop that sends that response back to the client.

4. Why is Node.js Single-threaded?
   Node.js is single-threaded for async processing. By doing async processing on a single-thread under typical web loads, more performance and scalability can be achieved instead of the typical thread-based implementation.
5. Explain callback in Node.js.
   A callback function is called after a given task. It allows other code to be run in the meantime and prevents any blocking. Being an asynchronous platform, Node.js heavily relies on callback. All APIs of Node are written to support callbacks.
6. How would you define the term I/O?
   • The term I/O is used to describe any program, operation, or device that transfers data to or from a medium and to or from another medium
   • Every transfer is an output from one medium and an input into another. The medium can be a physical device, network, or files within a system

7. How is Node.js most frequently used?
   Node.js is widely used in the following applications:
8. Real-time chats
9. Internet of Things
10.   Complex SPAs (Single-Page Applications)
11.   Real-time collaboration tools
12.   Streaming applications
13.   Microservices architecture
14.   Explain the difference between frontend and backend development?
      Front-end Back-end
      Frontend refers to the client-side of an application Backend refers to the server-side of an application
      It is the part of a web application that users can see and interact with It constitutes everything that happens behind the scenes
      It typically includes everything that attributes to the visual aspects of a web application It generally includes a web server that communicates with a database to serve requests
      HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AngularJS, and ReactJS are some of the essentials of frontend development Java, PHP, Python, and Node.js are some of the backend development technologies

NPM stands for Node Package Manager, responsible for managing all the packages and modules for Node.js.
Node Package Manager provides two main functionalities:
• Provides online repositories for node.js packages/modules, which are searchable on search.nodejs.org
• Provides command-line utility to install Node.js packages and also manages Node.js versions and dependencies  
10. What are the modules in Node.js?
Modules are like JavaScript libraries that can be used in a Node.js application to include a set of functions. To include a module in a Node.js application, use the require() function with the parentheses containing the module's name.

Node.js has many modules to provide the basic functionality needed for a web application. Some of them include:
Core Modules Description
HTTP Includes classes, methods, and events to create a Node.js HTTP server
util Includes utility functions useful for developers
fs Includes events, classes, and methods to deal with file I/O operations
url Includes methods for URL parsing
query string Includes methods to work with query string
stream Includes methods to handle streaming data
zlib Includes methods to compress or decompress files 11. Why is Node.js preferred over other backend technologies like Java and PHP?
Some of the reasons why Node.js is preferred include:
• Node.js is very fast
• Node Package Manager has over 50,000 bundles available at the developer’s disposal
• Perfect for data-intensive, real-time web applications, as Node.js never waits for an API to return data
• Better synchronization of code between server and client due to same code base
• Easy for web developers to start using Node.js in their projects as it is a JavaScript library 12. What is the difference between Angular and Node.js?
Angular Node.js
It is a frontend development framework It is a server-side environment
It is written in TypeScript It is written in C, C++ languages
Used for building single-page, client-side web applications Used for building fast and scalable server-side networking applications
Splits a web application into MVC components Generates database queries 13. Which database is more popularly used with Node.js?

15. What are the pros and cons of Node.js?
    Node.js Pros Node.js Cons
    Fast processing and an event-based model Not suitable for heavy computational tasks
    Uses JavaScript, which is well-known amongst developers Using callback is complex since you end up with several nested callbacks
    Node Package Manager has over 50,000 packages that provide the functionality to an application Dealing with relational databases is not a good option for Node.js
    Best suited for streaming huge amounts of data and I/O intensive operations Since Node.js is single-threaded, CPU intensive tasks are not its strong suit
16. What is the command used to import external libraries?
    The “require” command is used for importing external libraries. For example - “var http=require (“HTTP”).” This will load the HTTP library and the single exported object through the HTTP variable.
    Now that we have covered some of the important beginner-level Node.js interview questions let us look at some of the intermediate-level Node.js interview questions.

Intermediate Node.js Interview Questions 17. What does event-driven programming mean?
An event-driven programming approach uses events to trigger various functions. An event can be anything, such as typing a key or clicking a mouse button. A call-back function is already registered with the element executes whenever an event is triggered. 18. What is an Event Loop in Node.js?
Event loops handle asynchronous callbacks in Node.js. It is the foundation of the non-blocking input/output in Node.js, making it one of the most important environmental features.

22. How would you use a URL module in Node.js?
    The URL module in Node.js provides various utilities for URL resolution and parsing. It is a built-in module that helps split up the web address into a readable format.

23. What is the Express.js package?
    Express is a flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a wide set of features to develop both web and mobile applications
24. How do you create a simple Express.js application?
    • The request object represents the HTTP request and has properties for the request query string, parameters, body, HTTP headers, and so on
    • The response object represents the HTTP response that an Express app sends when it receives an HTTP request

25. What are streams in Node.js?
    Streams are objects that enable you to read data or write data continuously.
    There are four types of streams:
    Readable – Used for reading operations
    Writable − Used for write operations
    Duplex − Can be used for both reading and write operations
    Transform − A type of duplex stream where the output is computed based on input
26. How do you install, update, and delete a dependency?

27. How do you create a simple server in Node.js that returns Hello World?

• Import the HTTP module
• Use createServer function with a callback function using request and response as parameters.
• Type “hello world."
• Set the server to listen to port 8080 and assign an IP address 28. Explain asynchronous and non-blocking APIs in Node.js.
• All Node.js library APIs are asynchronous, which means they are also non-blocking
• A Node.js-based server never waits for an API to return data. Instead, it moves to the next API after calling it, and a notification mechanism from a Node.js event responds to the server for the previous API call 29. How do we implement async in Node.js?
As shown below, the async code asks the JavaScript engine running the code to wait for the request.get() function to complete before moving on to the next line for execution.

30. What is the purpose of module.exports?
    A module in Node.js is used to encapsulate all the related codes into a single unit of code, which can be interpreted by shifting all related functions into a single file. You can export a module using the module.exports, which allows it to be imported into another file using a required keyword.
31. What is a callback function in Node.js?
    A callback is a function called after a given task. This prevents any blocking and enables other code to run in the meantime.
    In the last section, we will now cover some of the advanced-level Node.js interview questions.

32. What is REPL in Node.js?
    REPL stands for Read Eval Print Loop, and it represents a computer environment. It’s similar to a Windows console or Unix/Linux shell in which a command is entered. Then, the system responds with an output

33. What is the control flow function?
    The control flow function is a piece of code that runs in between several asynchronous function calls.
34. How does control flow manage the function calls?

35. What is the difference between fork() and spawn() methods in Node.js?
    fork() spawn()

fork() is a particular case of spawn() that generates a new instance of a V8 engine. Spawn() launches a new process with the available set of commands.
Multiple workers run on a single node code base for multiple tasks. This method doesn’t generate a new V8 instance, and only a single copy of the node module is active on the processor. 36. What is the buffer class in Node.js?
Buffer class stores raw data similar to an array of integers but corresponds to a raw memory allocation outside the V8 heap. Buffer class is used because pure JavaScript is not compatible with binary data 37. What is piping in Node.js?
Piping is a mechanism used to connect the output of one stream to another stream. It is normally used to retrieve data from one stream and pass output to another stream 38. What are some of the flags used in the read/write operations in files?

39. How do you open a file in Node.js?

40. What is callback hell?
    • Callback hell, also known as the pyramid of doom, is the result of intensively nested, unreadable, and unmanageable callbacks, which in turn makes the code harder to read and debug
    • improper implementation of the asynchronous logic causes callback hell
41. What is a reactor pattern in Node.js?
    A reactor pattern is a concept of non-blocking I/O operations. This pattern provides a handler that is associated with each I/O operation. As soon as an I/O request is generated, it is then submitted to a demultiplexer
42. What is a test pyramid in Node.js?

43. Describe Node.js exit codes.

44. Explain the concept of middleware in Node.js.
    Middleware is a function that receives the request and response objects. Most tasks that the middleware functions perform are:  
    • Execute any code
    • Update or modify the request and the response objects
    • Finish the request-response cycle
    • Invoke the next middleware in the stack
45. What are the different types of HTTP requests?
    HTTP defines a set of request methods used to perform desired actions. The request methods include:
    GET: Used to retrieve the data
    POST: Generally used to make a change in state or reactions on the server
    HEAD: Similar to the GET method, but asks for the response without the response body
    DELETE: Used to delete the predetermined resource
46. How would you connect a MongoDB database to Node.js?
    To create a database in MongoDB:
    • Start by creating a MongoClient object
    • Specify a connection URL with the correct IP address and the name of the database you want to create
